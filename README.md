**Simple To Do App** is an android app that allows building a todo list and basic todo items management functionality including adding new items, editing and deleting an existing item.

Submitted by: **Disha**

Time spent: **30 hours** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* User can **successfully add and remove items** from the todo list
* User can **tap a todo item in the list and bring up an edit screen for the todo item** and then have any changes to the text reflected in the todo list.
* User can **persist todo items** and retrieve them properly on app restart

The following **suggested** functionality is completed:

 - Persist the todo items into **SQLite** instead of a text file
 - Improve style of the todo items in the list using a **custom adapter**:
    Created List view with custom layout which consist of **Text view and Check    box**.
 - Code added for persisting checkbox value in sqlite.
 - Added support for **completion due dates** for todo items (and display within listview item).
 - Use a **DialogFragment** instead of new Activity for editing items
 - Added support for **selecting the priority** of each todo item (and display in listview item)
 - Tweaked the style **improving the UI / UX**, playing with colors or backgrounds
 - Anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality or user experience:-enabled **fast scrolling** and added   checkbox.
